Ok. So first step would be to create appsettings.json for the Bot project and the WebApp project.
For format, I have included appsettings.Example_Bot.json and appsettings.Example_WebApp.json  files.

You need to create appseetings.json files in both those projects based on the examples.
Note that you can create appsettings.Development.json files for development as well. 
ASP.net core handles that automatically. For the Bot console app, i would change the file I am reading from in the Settings class to switch between development and production. It didn't cause me any inconvenience so i didn't bother setting up environment variables and stuff.

Once you have created a you discord bot application on the developer's portal on discord's website. You need to write appropriate info in the appsettings.

And then, you just need to run the website or bot, and it should work.
